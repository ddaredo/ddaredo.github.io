through courses like CTI-110.</p>
<br><p>In my free time, I like staying up to date with open-source technologies like Ubuntu, 
which aligns with my interest in practical software solutions. Outside of tech, 
I’m a big fan of morning coffee—it’s the best way to start my day!</P>

<P>My GitHub account is where I store and manage my personal and collaborative coding projects. 
It serves as a version control platform where I can track changes, collaborate with others, and contribute 
to open-source projects. You can view my repositories, forks, and contributions to various projects.</P
<P>My GitHub account is where I manage and collaborate on web development projects. It hosts repositories that 
contain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for building responsive and dynamic websites. GitHub helps me track 
changes, collaborate with others, and deploy my projects using GitHub Pages.</P>

<P>The repository I created focuses on developing a fully responsive webpage. It contains the structure (HTML), 
styling (CSS), and interactivity (JavaScript) for the site. Additionally, the repository includes a README file
 detailing the project and its purpose, as well as comments in the code to enhance understanding.</P>

<P>Once cloned, I could access the webpage project files locally and make edits using a text editor or integrated 
development environment (IDE).</P>
