<h1>About Me.</h1>
<br>
I’m an enthusiastic IT professional with a passion for technology and problem-solving. Academically, I’m pursuing an Associate Degree in IT Service and Support. I enjoy exploring web development and systems management, currently deepening my knowledge through courses like CTI-110.

In my free time, I like staying up to date with open-source technologies like Ubuntu, which aligns with my interest in practical software solutions. Outside of tech, I’m a big fan of morning coffee—it’s the best way to start my day!

My GitHub account is where I store and manage my personal and collaborative coding projects. It serves as a version control platform where I can track changes, collaborate with others, and contribute to open-source projects. You can view my repositories, forks, and contributions to various projects.

My GitHub account is where I manage and collaborate on web development projects. It hosts repositories that contain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for building responsive and dynamic websites. GitHub helps me track changes, collaborate with others, and deploy my projects using GitHub Pages.

The repository I created focuses on developing a fully responsive webpage. It contains the structure (HTML), styling (CSS), and interactivity (JavaScript) for the site. Additionally, the repository includes a README file detailing the project and its purpose, as well as comments in the code to enhance understanding.

Once cloned, I could access the webpage project files locally and make edits using a text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).
